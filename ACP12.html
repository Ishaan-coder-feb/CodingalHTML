            Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of <mark>Pemberley Woods</mark> with some
            perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter. The park
            was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They entered it in one of its lowest points, and
            drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.

        Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view.

        It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody
        hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial
        appearance. Its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned.

        Elizabeth was <mark>delighted</mark>. She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where
        natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were all of them warm in their
        admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of <code>Pemberley</code> might be something!
