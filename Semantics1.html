                    Dogs have a long history with humans, dating back over 15,000 years when they were first domesticated from wolves. Early humans and dogs formed a partnership based on hunting and protection, and over time, dogs became loyal companions.
                    Today, dogs are bred for many purposes, from herding and guarding to companionship.When it comes to age, a dog’s lifespan usually depends on its size and breed.
                    Smaller breeds like Chihuahuas can live up to 15–20 years, while larger breeds like Great Danes often live around 7–10 years. A common rule is that one dog year roughly equals seven human years, but in reality, dogs age faster in their first few years and then more slowly later on.
