                                Dogs are the most popular pet on the planet! They evolved from a now-extinct species of
                                wolf.
                                They can learn over 100 words and gestures! Dog noses are at least 40x more sensitive
                                than ours!
                                Many work as assistance dogs, helping humans! They only sweat from their paws, and have
                                to cool down by panting.
                                Dogs have a long history with humans, dating back over 15,000 years when they were first
                                domesticated from wolves.
                                Early humans and dogs formed a partnership based on hunting and protection, and over
                                time, dogs became loyal companions.
                                Today, dogs are bred for many purposes, from herding and guarding to companionship.
                                When it comes to age, a dog’s lifespan usually depends on its size and breed.
                                Smaller breeds like Chihuahuas can live up to 15–20 years, while larger breeds like
                                Great Danes often live around 7–10 years.
                                A common rule is that one dog year roughly equals seven human years, but in reality,
                                dogs age faster in their first few years and then more slowly later on.
